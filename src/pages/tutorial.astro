      <h1>Tutorial</h1>

      <p>Note: In this tutorial we talk about the movement of electrons to simplify the conecept, but in real life they actually move in the opposite direction than what we say here.</p>
      <br>

      <h2>Basics</h2>
      <p>In electronics, we deal with two main units: voltage (V), which is the difference of potential between two points (think of the force pushing electrons to go from one point to another), while current (I) is the amount of electrons passing through a given point.</p>
      <p>In the beginner world, there is always a common ground, called VSS, GND or 0V. It's a point where there is no potential, so all the electrons want to go there. Thus if you connect a point that has 5V to GND, electrons will naturally flow from 5V to GND.</p>

      <h4>Resistors</h4>
      <p>One of the fundamental parts of electrical design is resistors, which are used to limit the current flow. They are characterized by it's resistance, given by the formula R = V / I, which is also known as Ohm’s law.</p>
      <p>If you put two resistors series, their resistance combine: It is equivalent to one resistor that has the resistance of the sum of the two original resistors. When two or more resistors are parallel, their total resistance is given by the formula Rtotal = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 + ...</p>

      <h4>Capacitors</h4>
      <p>Capacitors are like tiny batteries, they charge up when you apply a voltage across them, and their internal voltage increase. And discharge when the outside voltage is lower then their internal voltage.</p>

      <h4>Diodes</h4>
      <p>Diodes are simple electrical components that only allows electricity to flow in one direction. When you see a diode on the schematic, it is often represented with a small triangle with a bar, which represents that electricity can only flow in the direction the triangle is pointing to.</p>

      <h2>KiCAD quick start!</h2>
      <p>To design a PCB, we will use KiCAD! A free and open source CAD software. Download it <a href="https://www.kicad.org/" target="_blank">here</a></p>
      <p>Open up the app, and you will be presented with a small popup, click apply. And now you are presented with the main menu.</p>
      <p>You first need to create a new project: Go to File &gt; New Project and create it. After that, click on this button to open then schematic editor:</p>

      <img src="/tutorial/schematic.png" />
      <p>A schematic is basically a diagram of the electrical circuit that expresses what parts you use and how they are connected. Note that they don't convey irl positioning - draw your part anywhere you want!</p>

      <p>For this tutorial we are just going to make three button controlled LEDs. Firstly, we need a battery to power the device, so press A and search "Battery_cell", click OK and click anywhere on the schematic to place the component. When you are placing the component, you and also press R to rotate it! We are using CR2032s as batteries, so on the + side of the terminal, there will be 3V and on the opposite side, it will be ground.</p>

      <p>Add a few more components in the same way: Two LEDs named "LED" and two resistors named "R". Your schematic should look like this:</p>
      <img src="/tutorial/schematic-nc.png" />

      <p>The presence of LEDs are obvious, since we need them to be able to emit light. As the name of the name "Light Emitting Diodes" implies, their behaviour is the same as normal diodes, they just emit light at the same time.</p>

      <p>The use of resistors is essential - they prevent too much electricity from passing through the LEDs. Without a resistor, the hungry LEDs would gobble up as much electricity as possible, and end up too hot and burn itself. (No, there won't be any fires, they just make a small pop and turn black)</p>

      <p>For the values of the resistors, it is 220ohms!</p>

      <p>Time to add wires! Wires are basically paths that electricity will flow through. We would like to wire the positive end of our battery (the end where there is a +: Where electricity departs) up to the back of the LEDs. Then at the we wire the output of our LEDs up to the resistors. (You can change the order of the LED and resistor!) After that we will want to wire the other end of the reistor to the ground of the battery.</p>
      
      <p>To do this, hover your mouse over one end of a symbol, and press W to start wirering. Drag the wire around, if you want to make a turn, press W again to anchor your wire onto the current spot, and continue dragging. When you are at your desired destination symbol's end, press W to place. You should have something like this:</p>

      <img src="/tutorial/schematic-wc.png" />

      <p>Great job! Now it's the time to associate footprints to the symbols. Press the following button on the top of KiCAD:</p>

      <img src="/tutorial/link.png" />

      <p>You should be presented with a table of all the components you have placed. Press a symbol's row, find the corresponding footprint using the following table, search it up in the top bar and double click the right entry on the right hand side. Repeat this for each component.</p>

      <!-- TODO: Style this up -->

      <table>
      <thead>
      <tr>
      <th>Symbol</th>
      <th>Footprint</th>
      </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
      <tr>
      <td>R</td>
      <td>R_Axial_DIN0207_L6.3mm_D2.5mm_P7.62mm_Horizontal</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>LED</td>
      <td>LED_D5.0mm</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>Button</td>
      <td>SW_PUSH_6mm</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>Battery</td>
      <td>BatteryHolder_Multicomp_BC-2001_1x2032</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>NPN</td>
      <td>TO-92L_HandSolder</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>PNP</td>
      <td>TO-92L_HandSolder</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>C</td>
      <td>CP_Radial_D8.0mm_P5.00mm</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>R_Potentiometer</td>
      <td>Potentiometer_Runtron_RM-065_Vertical</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>Conn_01xN_Pin</td>
      <td>PinHeader_1xN_P2.54mm_Vertical (Replace N!)</td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>At the end, you should have something like this:</p>

      <p>Now go back to the starting KiCAD window, and press this button to open the PCB editor:</p>

      <h2>Advanced parts</h2>
      <h4>Transistors</h4>
      <p>Transistors are more complex, they are divided into NPN and PNP types, and they have three pins, called emmiter, collector and gate.</p>
      <img src="https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/a381d42773bcd403a74388d6688b6665c933234b_image.png">
      <p>In the case of a NPN transistor, the emmiter is where the electrons exits, the collector where the electrons enters. The gate is basically a control circuit. If it’s voltage is the voltage on the emitter, the transister won’t allow electrons to pass. Inversly, if it’s the voltage on the collector, the transistor will allow electrons to pass.</p>
