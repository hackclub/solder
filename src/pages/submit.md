### Create a Github Repo!

**Include a README.md with:**
- Description of your project
- Bill of materials (What parts did you use? Have a list of those items, plus their quantities!)
- Screenshots of the schematic, PCB, and 3D view of your board!
- Your slack username (for verification) 

**Also include in the repo:**
- Gerber and drill files of your board!

[Here's an example of a Github repo](https://github.com/cheyao/Open555) that @cyao made of Open555: a 555 IC, entirely with THT transistors!

### Ship it on Slack!

If you're not already on the Hack Club Slack, join here: https://hackclub.com/slack/!!

Head on over to #solder-ships! 

Post what you made - _ship_ it by sharing it with the world, via a slack message!

**In the slack message, include:**
- Github repo link - include a README in that repo, with all your KiCad files!
- Screenshot of your schematic, PCB, and 3d view of the PCB
- Write description explaning what your circuit does!

**Other things you could include:**
- Why did you decide to make that specific design?
- Was there a particularily challenging part?
- What did you learn while making it?
- Advice for others?
- Anything else you want to mention!

Anyone will be free to respond with feedback in thread. 

After either @acon or @cyao (on Slack) reacts with the  âœ…  emoji, it's approved! We'll DM you with a shipping form to fill out to get your kit :D

### Here from a workshop?

Your club leader (or teacher) will give you a form to fill out!

If you're in the Slack, you should still post it in #solder-ships. You'll get great feedback, and have others check over if your circuit is working! It'll also confirm whether your submission got accepted or not.

### Club leader?

DM @acon on slack to get a form for your members to fill out to ship, instead of going through the Slack flow!

Post a picture of your club meeting doing Solder in #solder-ships to get a special item shipped to you :D
