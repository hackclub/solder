### Already on the Hack Club Slack?

Head on over to #solder-ships! 

Post what you made - _ship_ it by sharing it with the world!

**In the post, include:**
- Github repo link - include a README in that repo, with all your KiCad files!
- Screenshot of your schematic, PCB, and 3d view of the PCB
- Write description explaning what your circuit does!

**Other things you could include:**
- Why did you decide to make that specific design?
- Was there a particularily challenging part?
- What did you learn while making it?
- Advice for others?
- Anything else you want to mention!

Anyone will be free to respond with feedback in thread. 

After either @acon or @cyao (on Slack) reacts with the  âœ…  emoji, it's approved! We'll DM you with a shipping form to fill out to get your kit :D

### Here from a club (or classroom) workshop?

Your club leader will give you a form to fill out!

If you're in the Slack, you should also post it in #solder-ships. You'll get great feedback, and have others check over if your circuit is working! It'll also confirm whether your submission got accepted or not.

### Not on the Slack yet, and not from a club?

Go join!

### Club leader?

DM @acon on slack to get a form for your members to fill out to ship, instead of going through the Slack flow!

Post a picture of your club meeting doing Solder in #solder-ships to get a special item shipped to you :D
