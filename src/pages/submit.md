### Already on the Hack Club Slack?

Head on over to #solder-ships! 

Post what you made - _ship_ it by sharing it with the world!

In the post, include:
- Github repo link - include a README in that repo, with all your KiCad files!
- screenshot of your schematic, PCB, and 3d view of the PCB
- description explaning what your circuit does

Some optional details you could add:
- How long did it take you?
- Was there a particularily challenging part?
- Advice for others?
- Why did you decide to make that specific design?
- Anything else you want to mention!

### Here from a club (or classroom) workshop?

Your club leader will give you a form to fill out!

If you're in the Slack, you should also post it in #solder-ships. You'll get great feedback, and have others check over if your circuit is working!

### Not on the Slack yet, and not from a club?

Go join!

### Club leader?

DM @acon on slack to get a form for your members to fill out to ship, instead of going through the Slack flow!

Post a picture of your club meeting doing Solder in #solder-ships to get a special item shipped to you :D
