### More things to do

Hack Club has a ton more amazing programs for you to learn + get resources from.

Here are some of my favourites:
- [OnBoard](https://hackclub.com/onboard/): make a PCB, get a $100 grant to manufactuer it!
- [Hackpad](https://hackpad.hackclub.com/): make a keyboard, get a grant to build the keyboard!
- Find the full list of programs [here](https://ysws.hackclub.com/)!

Was this your first time doing electronics? Unsure what to build next? 

Here's a fun list of ideas you could make:
- something with microcontrollers
- ttl with ic components 
- breaking out bare chips / devboards

Some hardware projects I personally think would be cool for you to make:
- a 3D printer!!! Infill
