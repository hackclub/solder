### KiCad Quick Start

Complete beginner? No worries!

This tutorial aims to teach you how to design a printed circuit board (PCB for short) from scratch.

To design PCBs, we use **KiCad**! It's free and open source. **Download it here: https://www.kicad.org/download/**

If you're not able to download anything, [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/) is a web-based alternative.

**After downloading KiCad:**

Open up the app, and you will be presented with a small popup; click apply. And now you are presented with the main menu.

You first need to create a new project: Go to File &gt; New Project and create it. It should look like this:

If it looks like that, congrats - you've just started your first PCB project!
