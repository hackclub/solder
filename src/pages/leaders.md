Hey you! Are you a leader of a Hack Club, whether it's in your school or someplace else? 

### Run a solder workshop!

But why?
- Solder is built with beginners in mind - but you could also make a lot of advanced, cool, wacky things with simple parts!
- After you run the initial workshop and your members ship their designs, I'll ship you a giant box with everyone's kits, together! You can then run another meeting with just soldering the kits, together.
- Customs will be paid for!
- Fast review + fulfillment times! 
- I'll send you a super secret special limited edition exclusive pin :eyes: 
- I'll give you all the support you'll need!
- Only prerequisite is to have made an accepted submission yourself
