Hey you! Are you a leader of a Hack Club?

### Run a solder workshop!

But why?

- Solder is built with beginners in mind - but you could also make a lot of advanced, cool, wacky things with simple parts!
- After you run the initial workshop and your members ship their designs, I'll ship you a giant box with everyone's kits, together! You can then run another meeting with just soldering the kits, together.
- Fast review + fulfillment times!
- I'll send you a super secret special limited edition exclusive sticker :eyes:

The only prerequisite: make an accepted submission yourself first!

To start, message @acon in slack!
